# Heart_disease_prediction
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical data. Using the Logistic Regression model, the system analyzes features like age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Key steps include data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and accuracy assessmenton both training and test data. The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on training data and 82% on test data, demonstrating its potential for early detection. A predictive system is also built to input patient data and provide an instant prediction. Tools used include Python, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
